Hijacking the BGE

Blender contains a fully functional game engine (BGE) that is highly useful for learning the concepts of game programming by breaking it down into three simple parts: Sensor, Controller, and Actuator.  An Ogre based game engine will likely have similar concepts in its internal API and game logic scripting.  Without a custom interface to define game logic, very often game designers may have to resort to having programmers implement their ideas in purely handwritten script.  This is prone to breakage because object names then end up being hard-coded.  Not only does this lead to non-reusable code, its also a slow process.  Why should we have to resort to this when Blender already contains a very rich interface for game logic?  By hijacking a subset of the BGE interface we can make this workflow between game designer and game programmer much better.

The OgreDocScene format can easily be extened to include extra game logic data.  While the BGE contains some features that can not be easily mapped to other game engines, there are many are highly useful generic features we can exploit, including many of the Sensors and Actuators.  Blender uses the paradigm of: 1. Sensor -> 2. Controller -> 3. Actuator.  In pseudo-code, this can be thought of as: 1. on-event -> 2. conditional logic -> 3. do-action.  The designer is most often concerned with the on-events (the Sensors), and the do-actions (the Actuators); and the BGE interface provides a clear way for defining and editing those.  Its a harder task to provide a good interface for the conditional logic (Controller), that is flexible enough to fit everyones different Ogre engine and requirements, so that is outside the scope of this exporter at this time.  A programmer will still be required to fill the gap between Sensor and Actuator, but hopefully his work is greatly reduced and can write more generic/reuseable code.

The rules for which Sensors trigger which Actuators is left undefined, as explained above we are hijacking the BGE interface not trying to export and reimplement everything.  BGE Controllers and all links are ignored by the exporter, so whats the best way to define Sensor/Actuator relationships?  One convention that seems logical is to group Sensors and Actuators by name.  More complex syntax could be used in Sensor/Actuators names, or they could be completely ignored and instead all the mapping is done by the game programmer using other rules.  This issue is not easily solved so designers and the engine programmers will have to decide upon their own conventions, there is no one size fits all solution.

Supported Sensors:
    . Collision
    . Near
    . Radar
    . Touching
    . Raycast
    . Message

Supported Actuators:
    . Shape Action*
    . Edit Object
    . Camera
    . Constraint
    . Message
    . Motion
    . Sound
    . Visibility

*note: Shape Action
The most common thing a designer will want to do is have an event trigger an animation.  The BGE contains an Actuator called "Shape Action", with useful properties like: start/end frame, and blending.  It also contains a property called "Action" but this is hidden because the exporter ignores action names and instead uses the names of NLA strips when exporting Ogre animation tracks.  The current workaround is to hijack the "Frame Property" attribute and change its name to "animation".  The designer can then simply type the name of the animation track (NLA strip).  Any custom syntax could actually be implemented here for calling animations, its up to the engine programmer to define how this field will be used.  For example: "*.explode" could be implemented to mean "on all objects" play the "explode" animation.
