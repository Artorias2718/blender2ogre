   +- converter.py                                 # OgreXmlConverter wrapper

A more clear separation between realXtend, Jmoneky, ... has been made. As I see this now this plugin
is mainly for exporting to ogre file format, thus all other code should be moved out...

What I have done:

* moved 'general purpuse' code into util.py
* CMesh is not used in the source code. moved to unused.py
* JMonkey moved to unused. There was a comment saying 'todo: remove...'
* The setup of _TXML_ -> _OgreCommonExport_ +-> OgrePlugin
                                            |
                                            +-> realXtend Plugin

is a bit weired, I don't see why there should be a dependency on _TXML_, since it is only used
for realXtend... now it is the following way:

_OgreCommonExport_ +-> OgrePlugin
                   |
                   +-> _TXML_ -> realXtend Plugin

OgrePlugin does not redefine properties of _OgreCommonExport_ (EX_* = TypeProperty(...) )
* different parts of ogre export (image,material,mesh,program,skeleton) got their own modules
* moved the rpython code to the rogre folder
* moved NVIDIA texture tool doc into unused.py

This resulted in about ~2200 loc in blender2ogre/__init__.py (from 7730).
I even further reduced it to 2000 loc, and removed some duplicate code.
