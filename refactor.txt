The new structure:

+- plugin.py                                       # changelog and importing the rest of the plugin
 += blender2ogre/                                  # python source code
  += ogre/                                         # code specific to ogre, export formats, xml, materials, ...
  += tundra/                                       # real extend
  +- config.py                                     # configuration loading, saving
 += launch/                                        # several launch scripts (windows bat, linux sh, ...)


A more clear separation between realXtend, Jmoneky, ... has been made. As I see this now this plugin
is mainly for exporting to ogre file format, thus all other code should be moved out...

What I have done:

* moved 'general purpuse' code into util.py
* CMesh is not used in the source code. moved to unused.py
* JMonkey moved to unused. There was a comment saying 'todo: remove...'
* The setup of _TXML_ -> _OgreCommonExport_ +-> OgrePlugin
                                          |
                                          +-> realXtend Plugin

is a bit weired, I don't see why there should be a dependency on _TXML_, since it is only used
for realXtend... now it is the following way:

_OgreCommonExport_ +-> OgrePlugin
                   |
                   +-> _TXML_ -> realXtend Plugin
* moved VERSION into version.py
* different parts of ogre export (image,material,mesh,program,skeleton) got their own modules
* moved the rpython code to the rogre folder
* moved NVIDIA texture tool doc into unused.py
