## Rewrite ##

The repository located [here](https://bitbucket.org/MindCalamity/blender2ogre) is a *single* monolitic Python file.
This is not maintainable, and contians a tremendous amount of bugs. There was the need to export blender model to ogre from
the console, thus I rewrote the whole script and split it into several files.
It has been well tested on linux 64-bit and should work with others.

## Additional Features ##
